# MVC CMS Blogging Website

[![Deployed](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dw-mvc-bloggy-ptd-0f7d5a1fecf6.herokuapp.com/)

Model View Controller routing front and back end using Handlebars, Express.js, MySQL and Sequelize to create a content management system style blog.

## Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate MVC functionality in a fullstack web application. The app provides a front end user experience creating, sharing and viewing blog posts as well as back end authentication, database management and API.

Specific criteria for this project were to design a working model view controller file structure to manage all the functionality of the website, implement various protected and unprotected routes, store session data as client-side cookie, and deploy the site on Heroku. The criteria and tools are determined by the bootcamp curriculum.

### Note

Currently, some features are absent: 

- View individual blog posts and see all related comments
- Add new comments to blog posts
- Edit existing blog posts

Additionally, the front end design and CSS are not in place as what work could be done was focused on MVC elements and routing (i.e. it ain't pretty, but it works... mostly). Development will continue to finalize features and UI.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The app runs in web browsers. Users will land on the homepage with visible blog posts from other users (Currently, user can only see limited data). The nav bar will take the user to Home, Dashboard, or Login. The Dashboard is protected and requires users to be logged in to interact with their Dashboard. Selecting Dashboard should redirect the user and prompt them to either login with existing credentials or sign-up with a username and password. 

Once the user is logged in, they can navigate to the Dashboard, where they will have the option to write a new blog post and add it. They may also view their post history and delete any post they like. 

Additional functions not available at this time.
